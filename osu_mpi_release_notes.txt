 OSU MPI MVAPICH-0.9.7, Rev 0.9.7-mlx2.2.0 in OFED 1.1 Release Notes

                          October 2006


Overview
--------
These are the release notes for OSU MPI MVAPICH-0.9.7, Rev 0.9.7-mlx2.2.0
This is OFED's edition of the OSU MPI MVAPICH-0.9.7 release. OSU MPI is an MPI
channel implementation over InfiniBand from Ohio State University (OSU)
(http://nowlab.cse.ohio-state.edu/projects/mpi-iba/).

Software Dependencies
---------------------
OSU MPI depends on the installation of the OFED Distribution stack with OpenSM
running. The MPI module also requires an established network interface (either
InfiniBand IPoIB or Ethernet).

New Features
------------
The mlx2.2.0 module is based on the MVAPICH-0.9.7 (MPI-1 over OpenIB/Gen2) module at
openib.org gen2.  This version for OFED has the following additional features:
- Message coalescing
- SRQ flow optimization

Bug Fixes
---------
- Affinity support is now enabled by default
- Multiple fixes in rsh/ssh launcher
- LD_LIBRARY_PATH fix (MLNX #37387)
- TotalView scalability fix
- FastPath is enabled on start for small clusters
- Fix for correct f90 support (openib bugzilla 191)
- Fix for comment support in mpirun_rsh (openib bugzilla 143)

Known Issues
------------
- A process running MPI cannot fork after MPI_Init. Using fork might cause a
  segmentation fault.
- Using mpirun with ssh has a signal collection problem. Killing the run
  (using CTRL-C) might leave some of the processes running on some of the
  nodes. This can also happen if one of the processes exits with an error.
  Note: This problem does not exist with rsh.
- The MPD job launcher feature of OSU MPI module has not been tested by Mellanox
  Technologies.  See http://nowlab.cse.ohio-state.edu/projects/mpi-iba/ for more
  details.
- For users of Mellanox Technologies firmware fw-23108 or fw-25208 only:
  OSU MPI might fail in its default configuration if your HCA is burnt with an
  fw-23108 version that is earlier than 3.4.000, or with an fw-25208 version
  4.7.400 or earlier.
  Workaround:
  Option 1 - Update the firmware
  Option 2 - In mvapich.conf, set VIADEV_SRQ_ENABLE=0
- MVAPICH does not run on RHEL4 U3 ppc64
- MVAPICH may fail to run on some SLES 10 machines due to problems in resolving
  the host name.
  Workaround: Edit /etc/hosts and comment-out/remove the line that maps 
  IP address 127.0.0.2 to the system's fully qualified hostname.

Main Verification Flows

In order to verify the correctness of OSU MPI, the following tests and
parameters were run.
