		   ipath in OFED 1.2 Release Notes
			  
			       June 2007


Overview
--------
ipath is the low level driver implementation for all QLogic InfiniPath HCAs.


1. MSI (Message Signalled Interrupt) support required with
   QLogic InfiniPath HCAs
----------------------------------------------------------
The QLogic InfiniPath adapter requires MSI (Message Signalled
Interrupts) to be enabled in the kernel.

1.1. If the InfiniPath driver is intalled on a machine without
CONFIG_PCI_MSI=y configured, a warning similar to this will appear in
dmesg at boot:

[root@sqa-00 ~]# dmesg | grep ipath
  ib_ipath 0000:01:00.0: infinipath0: QLogic PCIE device 0x10 cannot work if 
  CONFIG_PCI_MSI is not enabled

2. Note: 
--------
When running Fedora Core 4 with the QLogic InfiniPath adapters, it is
recommended to use the 2.6.17 kernel.
