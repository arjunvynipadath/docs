1. Overview
===============================================================================
mlx4 is the low level driver implementation for the ConnectX adapters designed
by Mellanox Technologies. The ConnectX can operate as an InfiniBand adapter,
as an Ethernet NIC, or as a Fibre Channel HBA. To accommodate the three flavors,
the driver is split into two modules:
    
- mlx4_core
	Handles low-level functions like device initialization and firmware
	commands processing. Also controls resource allocation so that the
	InfiniBand, Ethernet and FC functions can share a device without
	interfering with each other.
- mlx4_ib
	Handles InfiniBand-specific functions and plugs into the InfiniBand
	midlayer

mlx4 Available Parameters
--------------------------
In order to set mlx4 parameters, add the following line to /etc/modpobe.conf:
   options mlx4_core parameter=<value>

   mlx4_core parameters:
   msi_x:		attempt to use MSI-X if nonzero (default 1)
   enable_qos:		Enable Quality of Service support in the HCA if > 0, (default 1) 
   internal_err_reset:	Reset device on internal errors if non-zero (default 1)
   debug_level:		Enable debug tracing if > 0 (default 0)
   log_num_qp:		log maximum number of QPs per HCA 
   log_num_srq:		log maximum number of SRQs per HCA 
   log_rdmarc_per_qp:	log number of RDMARC buffers per QP 
   log_num_cq:		log maximum number of CQs per HCA 
   log_num_mcg:		log maximum number of multicast groups per HCA
   log_num_mpt:		log maximum number of memory protection table entries per HCA 
   log_num_mtt:		log maximum number of memory translation table segments per HCA


===============================================================================
2. Supported Firmware Version
===============================================================================
- This release must be used with firmware version 2.2.000 or later. 

- This release was tested with FW 2.3.000

===============================================================================
3. Fixed Bugs and Enhancements from OFED 1.2.5.5

===============================================================================
4. Known Issues
===============================================================================
- The following commands and/or features are not supported:
  o Resize CQ
  o APM
  o SQD

- To load the driver on machines with 64KB default page size UAR bar must be
  enlarged. 64KB page size is the default of PPC with RHEL5 and Itanium with
  64KB page size enabled.
  Perform the following three steps:
  1. Add the following line in the firmware configuration (INI) file under the
     [HCA] section:
       log2_uar_bar_megabytes = 5
  2. Burn a modified firmware image with the changed INI file
  3. Reboot the system
     
- When creating a QP, do not use the max_qp_wr returned by ibv_query_device as 
  is for specifying the "max_send_wr" capability.  The maximum value used for
  max_send_wr should be (max_qp_wr - 33).
