	     Open Fabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED)
              iSER initiator in OFED 1.2 Release Notes
			  
			   May 2007


* Background

	iSER allows iSCSI to be layered over RDMA transports (including InfiniBand 
	and iWARP (RNIC)).

	The OpenIB iSER initiator implementation is interoperable with open-iscsi 
	(http://www.open-iscsi.org/). It provides an alternative transport to 
	iscsi_tcp in the open iscsi framework. The iSER transport exposes a 
	transport API to scsi_transport_iscsi, and a SCSI LLD API to the Linux 
	SCSI mid-layer (scsi_mod).

* supported platforms

	SLES10 (RC1 and later)

	the release has been tested against Voltaire iSCSI/iSER target running 
	in Voltaire's IB/Fibre-Channel router 

* known issues 

	SCSI command aborts may cause some instabilities
	
* iSER links
