	     Open Fabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED)
              iSER initiator in OFED 1.2 Release Notes
			  
			   June 2007


* Background

	iSER allows iSCSI to be layered over RDMA transports (including InfiniBand 
	and iWARP (RNIC)).

	The OpenFabrics iSER initiator implementation is interoperable with open-iscsi 
	(http://www.open-iscsi.org/). It provides an alternative transport to 
	iscsi_tcp in the open-iscsi framework. The iSER transport exposes a 
	transport API to scsi_transport_iscsi, and a SCSI LLD API to the Linux 
	SCSI mid-layer (scsi_mod). Currently, the OpenFabrics iSER initiator can be
	layered over InfiniBand (no iWARP support yet).

* supported platforms

	SLES 10
	SLES 10 sp1
	RHEL 5

	The release has been tested against Voltaire iSCSI over iSER target running
	in Voltaire's IB/Fibre-Channel router. It was also tested against
	FalconStor's iSCSI over iSER target (IPStor).

* known issues 

	SCSI command aborts may cause some instabilities
	
* iSER links
