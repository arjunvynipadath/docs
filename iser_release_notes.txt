	     Open Fabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED)
              iSER initiator in OFED 1.3 Release Notes
			  
			   February 2008


* Background

	iSER allows iSCSI to be layered over RDMA transports (including
	InfiniBand and iWARP (RNIC)).

	The OpenFabrics iSER initiator implementation is interoperable with
	open-iscsi (http://www.open-iscsi.org/). It provides an alternative
	transport to iscsi_tcp in the open-iscsi framework. The iSER transport
	exposes a transport API to scsi_transport_iscsi, and a SCSI LLD API to
	the Linux SCSI mid-layer (scsi_mod). Currently, the OpenFabrics iSER
	initiator can be layered over InfiniBand (no iWARP support yet).

* Supported platforms

	SLES 10
	SLES 10 sp1
	RHAS 4 up4
	RHAS 4 up5
	RHAS 4 up6
	RHEL 5
	RHEL 5.1

	The release has been tested against Voltaire iSCSI over iSER target
	running in Voltaire's IB/Fibre-Channel router (SR4G).

* Installation/upgrade of open-iscsi
	If iSER is selected to be installed with OFED, open-iscsi will be also
	installed (or upgraded if another version of open-iscsi is already
	installed).  Installing/upgrading open-iscsi is required for iSER to
	work properly. Before installing OFED, please make sure that no version
	of open-iscsi is installed or add the following key to your ofed.conf
	file: upgrade_open_iscsi=yes. Using this key will remove any old version
	of open-iscsi.

	If an older version of open-iscsi was installed, it is recommended to
	delete its records before running open-iscsi. This can easily be done by
	running the following command (while open-iscsi is stopped):

	rm -rf /etc/iscsi/nodes/* /etc/iscsi/send_targets/*

	Then, open-iscsi may be started, and targets may be discovered by running
	'iscsi_discovery <target_ip>'.
