		    ehca in OFED 1.1 Release Notes
			  
			   October 2006


Overview
--------
ehca is the low level driver implementation for all IBM GX-based HCAs.

ehca Available Parameters
--------------------------
In order to set ehca parameters, add the following line(s) to /etc/modprobe.conf:

	options ib_ehca <parameter>=<value>

whereby <parameter> is one of the following items:
- debug_level     debug level (0: no debug traces (default), 1: with debug traces)
- nr_ports        number of connected ports (default: 2)
- port_act_time   time to wait for port activation (default: 30 sec)

Known Issues
------------

1. The device driver normally uses both ports. For using just one port connect
the ports as shown in Figure 1 and load the device driver by running
`modprobe ib_ehca nr_ports=1`.

*Figure 1:* Connections if only one port is used.

NOTE: In OpenPower 720 and p550 port 1 is at the top, port 2 is at the bottom.

2. Furthermore the port(s) needs to be connected to an active switch port while
loading the ehca device driver.
