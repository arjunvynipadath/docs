			    ib_srp Release Notes
				   May 2014

========
Overview
========

The ib_srp kernel driver is a SCSI low-level initiator driver (LLD). This
means that this kernel driver makes communication via the SCSI protocol with
an SRP target system possible. The version of the SRP initiator included in
OFED 3.12 is derived from the upstream v3.12 Linux kernel SRP initiator driver
and has been ported to RHEL 6 and SLES 11. Lockless operation is enabled in
combination with RHEL 6.2 and later, with SLES 11 and also with upstream
kernel v2.6.37 and later but not with RHEL 6.0 nor with RHEL 6.1. For more
information about lockless dispatching of SCSI commands, see also the RHEL 6.2
