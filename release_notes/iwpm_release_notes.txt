		Release Notes for libiwpm-1.0.2
		Distributed with OFED-3.18
			July 2015

DESCRIPTION

libiwpm provides a user space service (iwpmd) for the iWarp drivers
to claim tcp ports through the standard socket interface.
The drivers currently using the service are Intel nes and Chelsio cxgb4.

PREREQUISITES

libiwpm requires libnl-1 or higher version and the corresponding libnl-devel
to be installed.

The kernel space support for the port mapper is part of the iw_cm module.
The ib_core module includes netlink support, which is used by the port mapper 
clients to exchange messages with iwpmd. Both modules iw_cm and ib_core need to 
be loaded in order for the libiwpm service to start successfully.

If the libiwpm is installed, but the required modules aren't loaded, you need to
load the modules and then restart the libiwpm service.

OFED-3.18 is the first OFED package to include libiwpm.

STARTING THE SERVICE

After installing an OFED package which includes libiwpm, the service should start 
automatically after reboot.

To check if the service is running:
ps aux | grep iwpmd

To start/stop the libiwpm service use:
service iwpmd start
service iwpmd stop

With systemd, to start/stop the libiwpm service use:
systemctl start iwpmd
systemctl stop iwpmd

BUILDING NOTES 

cd libiwpm-1.0.x
./configure --prefix /usr
make
make install 

To start the service manually:

/usr/bin/iwpmd

CHANGES:

- Allow registration of multiple devices per netlink client
- Fixes to enable the iwpmd install and start when systemd is available
- Adding "ulimit -n 102400" to the start up scripts to allow testing with
  high number of connections
- Adding functionality to enable libiwpm to provide the remote connecting
  peer address information to its clients
- Adding SIGUSR1 handler to print all port mapper mappings which are in use
- Adding support for handling wild card IP addresses
