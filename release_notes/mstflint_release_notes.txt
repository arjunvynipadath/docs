* NA

===============================================================================
4. Known Issues
===============================================================================

* Rarely you may get the following error message when running mstflint:
      Warning: memory access to device 0a:00.0 failed: Input/output error.
      Warning: Fallback on IO: much slower, and unsafe if device in use.
      *** buffer overflow detected ***: mstflint terminated

  To solve the issue, run "mst start" (requires MFT - Mellanox Firmware Tools package) and
  then re-run mstflint.

* Runing burning tools and restarting the driver at the same time may
   cause the machine to hang.

  To avoid this issue, do not run the burning tools while restarting the driver.

* Failure to set GUIDs on Connect-IB.

  To solve this issue set the GUIDs only when firmware is not active (driver not loaded)
   by using the flag -override_cache_replacement.

* Running the tools given in this package in parallel may not work.

  To avoid the issue, refrain from running more than one tool at at time with the same device.
