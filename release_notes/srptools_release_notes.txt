			    srptools Release Notes
				   May 2014

========
Overview
========

The srptools package contains tools for discovering SRP target ports in an
InfiniBand network. The best known software component in this package is
srp_daemon, a process that runs in the background, periodically scans a fabric
for SRP target ports and makes the SRP initiator kernel driver (ib_srp) log in
to the SRP target ports enabled in the srp_daemon.conf configuration file.

Changelog
=========

Version 1.0.2 (February 20, 2014)
.................................

- Added support for specifying tl_retry_count in srp_daemon.conf. Changed
  default behavior for tl_retry_timeout parameter from setting it to 2 into
  leaving it at its default value (7). This makes srp_daemon again compatible
  with the SRP initiator driver from kernel 3.12 and before.

Version 1.0.1 (February 4, 2014)
................................

- Make process uniqueness check work.
- Unsubscribe from subnet manager for traps before exiting.
- Added support for the comp_vector and queue_size configuration file options.

Version 1.0.0 (October 1, 2012)
...............................

- srp_daemon keeps working even if the LID changes of the port it is using to
  scan the fabric or if a P_Key change occurs.
- Added P_Key support to srp_daemon and ibsrpdm.
- Fixed month in srp_daemon.log (OFED bug #2281). srp_daemon now uses syslog
  and logrotate for logging.
- srp_daemon is now only started for InfiniBand ports. It is no longer
  attempted to start srp_daemon on Ethernet ports.
- Added support for specifying the tl_retry_count parameter. By default use
  tl_retry_count=2.
- Allow srp_daemon to be started without configuration file.
- Fixed a memory leak in srp_daemon that was triggered once during every fabric
  rescan.
- Reduced memory consumption of the srp_daemon process.
- MAD transaction ID 0 is skipped after 2**32 rescans.
- Installation: SRPHA_ENABLE=no / SRP_DAEMON_ENABLE=no is only added to
  /etc/infiniband/openibd.conf if these variables did not yet exist in that
  file.
- Changed range of the srp_daemon and ibsrpdm exit codes from 0..127 into 0..1.
- Changed ibsrpdm such that it uses the new umad P_Key ABI. Running ibsrpdm
  does no longer cause a warning to be logged ("user_mad: process ibsrpdm did
  not enable P_Key index support / user_mad:
  Documentation/infiniband/user_mad.txt has info on the new ABI").
- Fixed spelling of several help texts and diagnostic messages.

Version 0.0.4 (August 30, 2009)
...............................

This is the version that was included in previous OFED versions, e.g. OFED 3.5.
