1.6 OFED Sources
----------------
All sources are located under git://git.openfabrics.org/

Linux:
------
URL: git://git.openfabrics.org/compat-rdma/linux-3.12.git
Branch: master

- Linux kernel sub-tree that includes files relevant for the OFED project only.
  Based on v3.12. Used to shorten git clone time.
  Note: the regular Linux git tree can be used as well.

compat:
-------
URL: git://git.openfabrics.org/compat-rdma/compat.git
Branch: ofed

- Based on compat project (https://github.com/mcgrof/compat). The compat module
  provides functionality introduced in newer kernels to older kernels through a
  set of header files and exported symbols.
  See https://github.com/mcgrof/compat/wiki for details.
- Used to replace kernel_addons in the previous OFED kernel tree.

compat-rdma:
------------
URL: git://git.openfabrics.org/compat-rdma/compat-rdma.git
Branch: master

User level Sources are downloaded from http://www.openfabrics.org/downloads/
as written in the BUILD_ID

The kernel sources are based on Linux 3.12 mainline kernel. Its patches
are included in the OFED sources directory.

===============================================================================
3. Known Issues
===============================================================================
The following is a list of general limitations and known issues of the various
components of the OFED 3.12-rc1 release.

01. When upgrading from an earlier OFED version, the installation script does
    not stop the earlier OFED version prior to uninstalling it.
    Workaround: Stop the old OFED stack (/etc/init.d/openibd stop) before
    upgrading to OFED 3.5 or reboot the server after OFED installation.
02. Memory registration by the user is limited according to administrator
    setting. See "Pinning (Locking) User Memory Pages" in OFED_tips.txt for
    system configuration.
03. Fork support from kernel 2.6.12 and above is available provided
    that applications do not use threads. fork() is supported as long as the
    parent process does not run before the child exits or calls exec().
    The former can be achieved by calling wait(childpid), and the latter can be
    achieved by application specific means.  The Posix system() call is
    supported.
04. The qib driver is supported only on 64-bit platforms.
05. IPoIB: brctl utilities do not work on IPoIB interfaces. The reason for that
    is that these utilities support devices of type Ethernet only.
06. In case uninstall is failing, check the error log and remove
    the remaining RPMs manually using 'rpm -e <rpms list>'.
07. On SLES11.x, set allow_unsupported_modules parameter to 1 in file:
    /etc/modprobe.d/unsupported-modules. Without this the modules will not
    load.
08. RDS is supported only on kernel.org 3.5 and not on any distro OS.
09. RHEL 6.5 is not supported in 3.12-rc1 but will be supported in the next OFED
    version which is OFED 3.12
10. Mellanox ConnectIB HCAs are not supported in OFED 3.12-rc1. See OFED 3.12
11. There are known issues with iWARP using Chelsio adapters which will be 
    resolved in OFED 3.12. See Bugs 2402, 2441 and 2445
12. There is an issue with dapl which will be resolved in the next release
    dapl 2.0.40 which will be included in OFED 3.12 - see Bug 2448
13. There is an issue with PSM when compiling with gcc >= 4.6. This will be 
    resolved in OFED 3.12 - see Bug 2430
14. There is an issue with NFSoRDMA when running on Power PC. This will be 
    resolved in OFED 3.12 - see Bug 2449
15. Newer SLES or RHEL patch kernels that are updates to the original kernel that is included in the 
    original SLES or RHEL distibutions may not work with OFED-3.12-rc1. The list of kernels that are supported are listed in
    section 1.2. 

Note: See the release notes of each component for additional issues.
