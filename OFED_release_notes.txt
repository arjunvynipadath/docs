===============================================================================
5. Known Issues
===============================================================================
The following is a list of general limitations and known issues of the various
components of the OFED 1.2 release.

1. When upgrading from older OFED versions, the installation script does not
   stop the old OFED version before uninstalling it. 
   Workaround: Stop the old OFED stack (/etc/init.d/openibd stop) before 
   upgrade to OFED 1.2.
2. Memory registration by the user is limited according to the administrator
   setting. See "Pinning (Locking) User Memory Pages" in OFED_tips.txt for
   system configuration.
3. Fork support from kernel 2.6.12 and above is available provided
   that applications do not use threads. The fork() is supported as long
   as the parent process does not run before the child exits or calls exec().
   The former can be achieved by calling wait(childpid), and the latter can be
   achieved by application specific means.  The Posix system() call is
   supported.
4. The ipath driver is supported only on 64-bit platforms.
5. There are issues using Intel's MPI with the Qlogic card driver that cause
   failures.

Note: See the release notes of each component for additional issues.
