              MVAPICH2-1.0.2 in OFED 1.3 Release Notes

                          February 2008


Overview
--------

These are the release notes for MVAPICH2-1.0.2.  This is OFED's edition of
the MVAPICH2-1.0.2 release. MVAPICH2 is an MPI-2 implementation over
InfiniBand and iWARP from the Ohio State University
(http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/).


User Guide
----------

For more information on using MVAPICH2-1.0.2, please visit the user guide at
http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/support/.


Software Dependencies
---------------------

MVAPICH2 depends on the installation of the OFED Distribution stack with
OpenSM running. The MPI module also requires an established network
interface (either InfiniBand, IPoIB, iWARP, uDAPL, or Ethernet). BLCR support
is needed if built with fault tolerance support.


New Features
------------

MVAPICH2 (MPI-2 over InfiniBand and iWARP) is an MPI-2 implementation based on
MPICH2.  MVAPICH2 1.0.2 is available as a single integrated package (with
MPICH2 1.0.5p4).  This version of MVAPICH2-1.0.2 for OFED has the following
changes from MVAPICH2-1.0.1:

- Explicitly name unions in struct ibv_wr_descriptor and reference the
  members in the code properly.
- Change "inline" functions to "static inline" properly.
- Increase the maximum number of buffer allocations for communication
  intensive applications.
- Corrections for warnings from the Sun Studio 12 compiler.
- If malloc hook initialization fails, then turn off registration
  cache.
- Add MV_R3_THESHOLD and MV_R3_NOCACHE_THRESHOLD which allows
  R3 to be used for smaller messages instead of registering the
  buffer and using a zero-copy protocol.
- Fixed an error in message coalescing.
- Setting application initiated checkpoint as default if CR is turned on.


Main Verification Flows
-----------------------

In order to verify the correctness of MVAPICH2-1.0.2, the following tests
and parameters were run.
