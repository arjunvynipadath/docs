               MVAPICH2-1.4.1 in OFED 1.5.1 Release Notes

                               March 2010


Overview
--------

These are the release notes for MVAPICH2-1.4.1.  This is OFED's edition
of the MVAPICH2-1.4.1 release. MVAPICH2 is an MPI-2 implementation over
InfiniBand and iWARP from the Ohio State University
(http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/).


User Guide
----------

For more information on using MVAPICH2-1.4.1, please visit the user
guide at http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/support/.


Software Dependencies
---------------------

MVAPICH2 depends on the installation of the OFED Distribution stack with
OpenSM running. The MPI module also requires an established network
interface (either InfiniBand, IPoIB, iWARP, uDAPL, or Ethernet). BLCR
support is needed if built with fault tolerance support.


New Features
------------

MVAPICH2 (MPI-2 over InfiniBand and iWARP) is an MPI-2 implementation
based on MPICH2.  MVAPICH2 1.4.1 is available as a single integrated
package (with MPICH2 1.0.8p1).  This version of MVAPICH2-1.4.1 for OFED
has the following changes from MVAPICH2-1.4:

MVAPICH2-1.4.1 (03/12/10)

* Enhancements since mvapich2-1.4
   - MPMD launch capability to mpirun_rsh
   - Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) support,
        - Patch suggested by Dr. Bernd Kallies 
   - Multi-port support for iWARP
   - Enhanced iWARP design for scalability to higher process count
   - Ring based startup support for RDMAoE

* Bug fixes since mvapich2-1.4
   - Fixes for MPE and other profiling tools
        - As suggested by Anthony Chan (chan@mcs.anl.gov)
   - Fixes for finalization issue with dynamic process management
   - Removed overrides to PSM_SHAREDCONTEXT, PSM_SHAREDCONTEXTS_MAX variables.
        - Suggested by Ben Truscott .
   - Fixing the error check for buffer aliasing in MPI_Reduce as
        - Suggested by Dr. Rajeev Thakur 
   - Fix Totalview integration for RHEL5
   - Update simplemake to handle build timestamp issues
   - Fixes for --enable-g={mem, meminit}
   - Improved logic to control the receive and send requests to handle the
     limitation of CQ Depth on iWARP
   - Fixing assertion failures with IMB-EXT tests
   - VBUF size for very small iWARP clusters bumped up to 33K
   - Replace internal mallocs with MPIU_Malloc uniformly for correct
     tracing with --enable-g=mem
   - Fixing multi-port for iWARP
   - Fix memory leaks
   - Shared-memory reduce fixes for MPI_Reduce invoked with MPI_IN_PLACE
   - Handling RDMA_CM_EVENT_TIMEWAIT_EXIT event
   - Fix for threaded-ctxdup mpich2 test
   - Detecting spawn errors
        - Patch contributed by Dr. Bernd Kallies 
   - IMB-EXT fixes reported by Yutaka from Cray Japan
   - Fix alltoall assertion error when LiMIC2 is used
